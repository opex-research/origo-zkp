# Circuits for Origo 

Check out the WIP [specification](https://docs.thezwift.com/technical-details/architecture/origo-tls-oracle) to learn how it works.

## Getting Started

[![CI Build & Test](https://github.com/opex-research/origo-zkp/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opex-research/origo-zkp/actions/circuits/workflows/go.yml)

To run the same tests as the CI, run ``./test.sh``, which executes all test cases in the ``/circuits`` folder.
